This file contains a list of people who are responsible for certain parts of
the HAProxy project and who have authority on them. This means that these
people have to be consulted before doing any change in the parts they maintain,
including when fixing bugs. These persons are allowed to reject any change on
the parts they maintain, and in parallel they try their best to ensure these
parts work well. Similarly, any change to these parts not being validated by
them will be rejected.

The best way to deal with such subsystems when sending patches is to send the
patches to the mailing list and to CC these people. When no maintainer is
listed for a subsystem, you can simply send your changes the usual way, and it
is also a sign that if you want to strengthen your skills on certain parts you
can become yourself a maintainer of the parts you care a lot about.

Please do not ask them to troubleshoot your bugs, it's not their job eventhough
they may occasionally help as time permits.
